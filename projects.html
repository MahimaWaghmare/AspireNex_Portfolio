                        The game challenges players to remember and repeat
                        increasingly complex sequences of colors.
                        <br><br>

                    <p>Technology used: ReactJS | CSS
                        <br><br>
                        I developed a dynamic weather website
                       using React, which fetches real-time 
                       weather data from an external API. 
                       <br><br>
                       The website allows users to input a city name 
                       and receive up-to-date weather information, 
                       including temperature, humidity, and weather 
                       conditions.  
                       <br><br>
                       By leveraging React's component-based 
                       architecture and state management, the website provides 
                       a responsive and user-friendly experience.
